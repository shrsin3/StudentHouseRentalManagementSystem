# Student House Rental Management System

A student house rental management system for university students in Canada and landlords who want to rent their spaces to students. This application will let landlords enter information about their housing spaces that are available for rent. It allows the landlord to change the status of the listed place if it has been rented. It will let the landlords remove a place from the listing. The students can use this application to view all the listings that are currently available.     

I am interested in this project because I have observed many of my friends struggle while finding housing off-campus or while finding housing in a new city where they might move for a short period of time for internships or jobs. Through this application, I want to connect the landlords and the students to make the process of finding and renting spaces easier.
